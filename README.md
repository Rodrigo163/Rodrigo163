### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rodrigo and I am currently finishing the Cognitive Systems Master's program at the University of Potsdam, a program specialised in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I will be doing my Master's thesis applying argument mining techniques to climate change discourse.
I am also currently working at the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces implementing Deep Learning and other Machine Learning techniques in the field of Molecular Dynamics simulations.

### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rodrigo and I am currently finishing the Cognitive Systems Master's program at the University of Potsdam, a program specialised in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I will be doing my Master's thesis applying argument mining techniques to climate change discourse with Prof. Dr. Manfred Stede. 

Here is a sample of the projects I've been part of during my Master's studies:
- [20 Questions game implementation](https://github.com/RodrigoLPA/twenty-questions)
- [Image Captioning system + Multimodal method for image retrieval](https://github.com/RodrigoLPA/sempix20)
- [Taboo game implementation](https://github.com/epankratz/nlp-taboo-implementation)

I am also currently working at the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces implementing Deep Learning and other Machine Learning techniques in the field of Molecular Dynamics simulations with Dr. Hanne Antila and Dr. Markus Miettinen. 

I am passionate about chaos and complexity emerging from simple systems, and in my free time I do visualizations of some of them. You can check them [here](https://github.com/Rodrigo163/Fractals-and-other-complex-systems) :)
